      <p>Welcome! I'm Shauna and I am passionate about programming and digital applications.</p>

      <p>I love to create beautiful, responsive applications that not only look terrific, but are also professional, user friendly, and will increase your conversions and sales. I also spend lots of time working on extra projects in my free time to keep up with web trends and to contribute to things I love (especially if it involves animals)!</p>

      <p>I have had the opportunity to work with companies both small and large - ranging from start-ups to companies with thousands of clients and data points in the millions. I enjoy challenging myself with new and out of the box projects and have worked with developers all over the globe.</p>

      <p>I am a full stack developer which means I can take your project from the initial concept all the way to the completed application. I have experience in both front and back end programming and have worked with many languages including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, PHP, and more.</p>

      <p>When I'm not coding, I love to create art and read all kinds of books.</p>

      <p>If you are looking for a designer and/or developer <a href="contact.html">get in touch!</a></p>
